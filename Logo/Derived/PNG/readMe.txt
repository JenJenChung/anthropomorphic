ACFR Logo, PNG Files
--------------------

These files are in Portable Network Graphics format which has replaced GIF for
Internet use due to issues with the GIF patent.

The filename encode the file type as follows:

  * 300: 300 pixels per inch 
  *  72:  72 pixels per inch (screen resolution)
  
  * W:  White background
  * T: Transparent background (please use cautiously and sensitively). 

Please note that it is better to use Enhanced Metafile (.emf) images in
Microsoft Office and similar applications because the EMF format preserves
vector information. The images remain 'crispness' at any scale.
