        alt="<b>Robotic Mobile Manipulation</b><p>Current robotic automation solutions typically offer 'islands of automation' where either mobility or manipulation is dealt with in isolation. Our research in this area aims to fill this gap in knowledge on combining both robotic mobility and manipulation modalities in complex, human-centred environments. Mobile manipulation tasks require robots that can interact with the world across a wide operational spectrum, from the (sub)millimetre precision required for fine manipulation to navigating across building- and campus-scale spaces. This motivates a holistic representation of the environment that facilitates the tight integration of socially aware planning, perception and control, and allows cognitive elements such as learning, reasoning and adaptation of actions for natural interaction.</p>"/>
        
        <img class="myImages" id="mImg" src="Home/navigation_in_crowds.png" height="256" hspace="10"
        alt="<b>Safe Robot Navigation in Dense Crowds</b><p>Navigating through human crowds is a tough challenge for a robot. Crowds can cause severe sensor occlusions and often don't leave much free space for the robot to move in, leading to what's known as the 'freezing robot problem'. As part of the European Commisssion H2020 CrowdBot Project, we are developing navigation and motion plannng algorithms that allow the robot to work with the flow of the crowd to get to its destination. We work on mapping, localisation, prediction, motion and interaction planning to help the robot answer four key questions for successful robot crowd navigation:</p><p>1. Where am I?</p><p>2. Who's around me?</p><p>3. Where am I going?</p><p>4. How should I get there?</p>"/>

        alt="<b>UAV Traffic Management</b><p>UAV traffic management in urban airspaces can be formulated as a problem of routing autonomously guided robots using cost space manipulation to induce safe trajectories in the work space. Each UAV does not explicitly coordinate with other vehicles in the airspace. Instead, they each execute their own individual internal cost-based planner to travel between locations. We are developing a high-level UAV traffic management (UTM) system that can dynamically adapt the cost space to reduce the number of conflict incidents in the airspace without needing explicit knowledge of the internal planners of each UAV. Our decentralized and distributed system of high-level traffic controllers each learn appropriate costing strategies via a neuro-evolutionary algorithm. The policies learned by our algorithm demonstrated a reduction in the total number of conflict incidents experienced in the airspace while maintaining throughput performance. Current research is looking at methods to account for traffic heterogeneity in the system.</p>"/>
        
        <img class="myImages" id="mImg" src="Home/probabilityOfImprovement.png" height="220" hspace="10"
        alt="<b>Risk Aware Graph Search</b><p>We are investigating novel approaches to searching a graph with probabilistic edge costs, namely, by incorporating available uncertainty information into the graph search. Our proposed risk aware graph search (RAGS) method consists of two major steps, the first is to perform an initial search across the graph to find the set of non-dominated paths. Following this, we perform risk-aware planning during path execution as information of the true neighboring edge costs become available. Initial results in a graph search domain have demonstrated superior performance when compared to A*, D* and a greedy approach.</p>"/>
        
        <img class="myImages" id="mImg" src="Home/structuralCreditAssignment.png" height="220" hspace="10"
        alt="<b>Structural Credit Assignment in Multiagent Policy Learning</b><p>Autonomous multi-robot teams can be used in complex tasks to improve performance in terms of both speed and effectiveness. However, use of multi-robot systems presents additional challenges. Specifically, in domains where the robots' actions are coupled, coordinating multiple robots to achieve cooperative behavior at the group level is difficult. Reward shaping can greatly benefit policy learning in multi-robot tasks and we are investigating various reward frameworks based on the idea of <i>counterfactuals</i> to tackle the structural credit assignment problem in these coupled domains.</p>"/>

The Australian Centre for Field Robotics developed a system to collect this data consisting of micro retro-reflectors (to be attached to the insects) and a UAV equipped with a strobe beacon to autonomously fly loops over the swarm to track and monitor insect locations in real-time.
